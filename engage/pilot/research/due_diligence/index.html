                    The stuff that wrecks a run doesn’t show up as a red alert.
                    It shows up as “looks fine” right until it isn’t.
                    The dashboard stays calm. The wall sensor says you’re on target.
                    Then you crack the canopy and find the truth living in the places your numbers don’t reach.
                  </p>

                  <p class="team-card__text">
                    If you’ve operated grows long enough, you’ve seen this movie:
                    a room that “holds setpoints” on paper still produces a recurring problem nobody can fully explain.
                    Same SOP. Same gear. Same people. Different outcome.
                    That’s not superstition — it’s geometry, airflow paths, and microclimates doing what they do.
                  </p>

                  <h3 class="team-card__role" style="margin-top:16px;">What it looks like when it goes wrong</h3>

                  <p class="team-card__text">
                    It usually starts small. A wet strip that never quite dries. A dead corner behind racks.
                    An under-canopy lane that feels “still” when you walk it. A night cycle that quietly pushes moisture
                    into places you don’t scout until it’s already baked in.
                  </p>

                  <p class="team-card__text">
                    And because the dashboard is averaging a room-sized reality into one number,
                    the failure stays invisible long enough to become expensive:
                    labor spikes, rework, remediation, retesting, schedule slips, yield loss —
                    and the emotional bonus round: explaining to leadership why the room was “in spec”
                    and still failed in the ways that matter.
                  </p>

                  <h3 class="team-card__role" style="margin-top:16px;">The five failure modes these pilots target</h3>

                  <ul class="team-card__text" role="list">
                    <li>
                      <strong>Canopy pockets are common.</strong>
                      There’s always a wet lane, a dead corner, a behind-the-rack strip, an under-canopy zone that never dries.
                      That’s not bad intention. That’s airflow + obstruction + density creating local humidity.
                      (Air-circulation guidance routinely calls out overcrowding as a driver of higher local RH and infection risk.)
                      <a href="#ref-csu" aria-label="Reference 1" title="Reference 1">[1]</a>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                      <strong>Powdery mildew pressure is an industry staple.</strong>
                      Not because people are lazy — because uneven circulation creates “quiet zones” where humidity dynamics favor disease.
                      You can have “good” average numbers and still have leaf-surface reality that’s basically inviting PM to move in.
                      <a href="#ref-egro" aria-label="Reference 2" title="Reference 2">[2]</a>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                      <strong>Botrytis (“bud rot”) moves fast under high RH.</strong>
                      Late flower doesn’t negotiate. When the conditions are right, the damage is rapid —
                      and the worst part is it can be localized inside dense flower structure where your room average never tells on it.
                      <a href="#ref-csp" aria-label="Reference 3" title="Reference 3">[3]</a>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                      <strong>Compliance failures (yeast/mold) and recalls are real.</strong>
                      When it hits, it’s not just a failed test. It’s a schedule wreck: holds, remediation, retesting,
                      lost yield, lost labor, and the “how did this happen?” meeting you don’t have time for.
                      Recalls tied to contamination do happen — and they pull real product in real markets.
                      <a href="#ref-cpr" aria-label="Reference 4" title="Reference 4">[4]</a>
                      <a href="#ref-wsj" aria-label="Reference 5" title="Reference 5">[5]</a>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                      <strong>Rules vary by state (including Aspergillus targets in some regimes).</strong>
                      What passes in one market fails in another. Same facility, different state, different list of targets,
                      different sampling/handling expectations, different definition of “acceptable.”
                      That patchwork creates business risk — not hypothetical risk.
                      <a href="#ref-mg" aria-label="Reference 6" title="Reference 6">[6]</a>
                      <a href="#ref-reuters" aria-label="Reference 7" title="Reference 7">[7]</a>
                    </li>
                  </ul>

                  <!-- Why “average RH” fails, in qualitative terms -->
                  <h3 class="team-card__role" style="margin-top:16px;">Why “average RH” lies to you</h3>

                  <p class="team-card__text">
                    “Average RH” is a comforting number. Clean. Legible. Board-room friendly.
                    But the canopy doesn’t live in averages. It lives in 3D:
                    blocked airflow, short-circuit paths, corners, under-canopy, behind structure,
                    and the cycling behavior of equipment that turns the room into a repeating weather pattern.
                  </p>

                  <p class="team-card__text">
                    That’s why operators end up saying, “We swear we held setpoints.”
                    You probably did — at the sensor.
                    The problem is the product doesn’t grow at the sensor.
                  </p>

                  <!-- What the pilot buys you -->
                  <h3 class="team-card__role" style="margin-top:16px;">What the pilot is really buying you</h3>

                  <p class="team-card__text">
                    These pilots are worth doing because they turn gut-feel arguments into evidence:
                    <strong>where the room is failing, how bad, and whether your fix worked.</strong>
                  </p>

                  <p class="team-card__text">
                    Practically, that means two things:
                  </p>

                  <ul class="team-card__text" role="list">
                    <li>
                      <strong>Find the pockets.</strong>
                      A zone-level view of the canopy so you can stop treating the whole room like one number.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Verify the change.</strong>
                      After you adjust airflow / dehu strategy / SOP execution, you re-measure and see if the pockets shrank,
                      moved, or persisted — instead of guessing and hoping.
                    </li>
                  </ul>

                  <!-- Risk multipliers (qualitative) -->
                  <h3 class="team-card__role" style="margin-top:16px;">When the odds get worse</h3>

                  <p class="team-card__text">
                    These issues are most likely when density is high, late flower is heavy, equipment is near capacity,
                    and airflow isn’t actually uniform — especially in corners, behind racks, near walls, and under canopy.
                    They’re less likely when airflow paths are validated and moisture control is stable —
                    but “less likely” is not “impossible.”
