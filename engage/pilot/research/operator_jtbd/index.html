                    Operators don’t run rooms on a single number. They run them on a calendar.
                    Lights, dehu, HVAC stages, irrigation, and labor all move on cycles — and the canopy responds on cycles too.
                    That’s why “average RH” can look fine while the room quietly fails where product actually lives.

                  <!-- Why cycle-driven -->
                  <h3 class="team-card__role">Canopy pockets are cycle-driven</h3>

                  <p class="team-card__text">
                    Pockets aren’t usually a permanent “bad spot” that screams all day.
                    They show up when normal operations push the room into a vulnerable phase:
                    lights-off transitions, temperature drops, dew-point proximity, equipment staging, dehu cycling,
                    or moisture events (irrigation / transpiration spikes).
                  </p>

                  <p class="team-card__text">
                    That’s the trap: if you sample the wrong window, you walk away convinced the room is fine.
                    The average stays pretty. The failure hides in the waveform.
                  </p>

                  <h3 class="team-card__role">Triggers reveal pockets — averages hide them</h3>

                  <p class="team-card__text">
                    Averages erase timing. Timing is the whole crime.
                    The question isn’t “what was RH?” — it’s
                    <strong>where did it spike, how long did it stay there, and did it repeat?</strong>
                  </p>

                  <hr style="border:none;border-top:1px solid rgba(0,0,0,0.12);margin:18px 0;" />

                  <!-- Short vs long pilots -->
                  <h3 class="team-card__role">Short pilots vs long pilots</h3>

                  <p class="team-card__text">
                    <strong>Short pilots = find + locate.</strong><br />
                    Short duration is for discovery: map the room, locate the bad zones, and identify at least one trigger window.
                    You walk away with a hit-list: corners, under-canopy lanes, behind racks, near walls, return paths, etc.
                  </p>

                  <p class="team-card__text">
                    <strong>Long pilots = repeatability + recurrence.</strong><br />
                    Long duration is proof. The same pockets show up again under the same triggers.
                    That’s when the conversation changes from “maybe” to “this is how the room behaves.”
                    And once you can predict it, you can fix it — and verify the fix without guessing.
                  </p>

                  <h3 class="team-card__role">Best signal is late-flower + night cycles</h3>

                  <p class="team-card__text">
                    Late flower is when the room stops being forgiving: biomass is up, air paths get blocked,
                    and small failures compound fast. Nights are where the room reveals itself:
                    temperature drops, RH climbs, and the canopy can quietly cross into “wet.”
                    If you don’t measure those windows, you miss the story.
                  </p>

                  <hr style="border:none;border-top:1px solid rgba(0,0,0,0.12);margin:18px 0;" />

                  <!-- Feature implications (JTBD -> product) -->
                  <h3 class="team-card__role">What this means for features (JTBD → build decisions)</h3>

                  <p class="team-card__text">
                    “Duration” isn’t a billing choice. It’s a feature requirement. If the system can’t see cycles,
                    it can’t do the job operators hire it for.
                  </p>

                  <ul class="team-card__text" role="list">
                    <li><strong>Cycle capture:</strong> measure across lights-on/off and night windows (not just daytime snapshots).</li>
                    <li><strong>Trigger tagging:</strong> label events like lights-off, dehu staging, HVAC stage change, irrigation windows.</li>
                    <li><strong>Recurrence scoring:</strong> show “this pocket repeats” vs “one-off anomaly.”</li>
                    <li><strong>Before/after verification:</strong> prove whether interventions actually changed the pocket behavior.</li>
                    <li><strong>Operator-proof outputs:</strong> a clean narrative report: where, when, how often, how bad, what changed.</li>
                  </ul>

                  <p class="team-card__text">
                    That’s the product: not “more data,” but <strong>less arguing</strong>.
                    Less guessing. Less “we swear we held setpoints.”
                    More control.
                  </p>
