                  <p class="team-card__text">
                    I’m Jonathan. I’m supposed to write a CEO bio here, which is already a mildly suspicious activity:
                    a small block of text trying to compress a human into a brand-shaped rectangle.
                  </p>

                  <p class="team-card__text">
                    I'm an engineer at heart, which mostly means I treat everything (including leadership) 
                    like a system that can be debugged.
                    I do not "optimize people." I optimize interfaces: how decisions get made, how information moves,
                    how incentives quietly bend outcomes, and how teams accidentally invent chaos when they don't mean to.
                  </p>

                  <p class="team-card__text">
                    
                    Nobody wakes up and says, "Today I will build a beautiful machine for misunderstanding,"
                    and yet—somehow—by Thursday we're in a recurring meeting about why the recurring meeting exists.
                  </p>

                  <p class="team-card__text">
                    That's the part of my "career summary" I can stand behind: I've spent enough time inside both large
                    companies and small ones to observe the same law of physics in different costumes.
                  </p>

                  <p class="team-card__text">
                    In big corporations, the reason a tiny startup can run circles around an established giant is not magic,
                    genius, or "hustle culture." It's simpler and more insulting: the people doing the essential work are...
                    actually doing the work. They're not trapped in an infinite loop of status updates, pre-meetings,
                    post-meetings, and calendar Tetris that turns "execution" into a spectator sport.
                  </p>

                  <p class="team-card__text">
                    And in startups, the reason they fail is rarely the founder's resume or vision. It's usually more
                    human than that: a lot of founders didn't start a company because they had some monastic clarity of purpose.
                    They started it because they have questionable impulse control, a suspicious relationship with boredom, and
                    a brain that treats "this might work" like a binding contract with destiny. (I say this with love, because
                    I'm not exactly writing this from a monastery.)
                  </p>

                  <h3 class="team-card__kicker">A few values that run the shop</h3>

                  <div class="team-card__values">
                    <p class="team-card__value-title">Strategy beats planning.</p>
                    <p class="team-card__text">
                      Plans are spreadsheets of hope. Strategy is the constraint you use when reality starts throwing chairs.
                      I care less about whether a roadmap looks tidy and more about whether we'll still make good decisions when
                      assumptions break, timelines slip, and the data shows up late (as it always does).
                    </p>

                    <p class="team-card__value-title">Systems beat goals.</p>
                    <p class="team-card__text">
                      Goals are nice. Systems are how you get there repeatedly without burning everyone out or "heroing" your way
                      through every deadline. If the system is sound, the outcomes follow. If the system is broken, goals become
                      motivational posters you eventually resent.
                    </p>

                    <p class="team-card__value-title">Not all postmodern ideas are completely bullshit. (A lot are. But not all.)</p>
                    <p class="team-card__text">
                      The useful part is the reminder that language isn't neutral. Stories shape what people notice, what they fear,
                      what they call "progress," what gets quietly ignored, and what ultimately gets believed. 
                      Leadership is partly engineering and partly
                      meaning-making: if you don't pay attention to framing, your org will accidentally build the wrong reality while
                      insisting it's being "data-driven."
                    </p>
                  </div>

                  <p class="team-card__text">
                    If that sounds too abstract: my default mode is this. Make the work legible. Make decisions reproducible.
                    Write things down. Test assumptions early. Reduce drama in the system. And occasionally admit, in public, that you
                    were wrong.
