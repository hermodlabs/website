            <p>
              If you're considering working with us, you deserve something better than glossy "culture" slogans.
            </p>
            <p>
              This post is us putting our philosophy on the table-plain language, full transparency-because we want
              social proof that we mean what we say. We don't want you to "trust the user interface."
              We want you to understand the operating system.

            <h2 id="s-2">Our north star: Asynchronous beats synchronous</h2>

            <p>Our biggest value is simple:</p>

            <p><strong>Asynchronous communication beats synchronous communication.</strong></p>

            <p>
              We didn't learn that from a leadership retreat. We learned it the boring way: computer science,
              distributed systems, parallel systems, and systems theory.
            </p>

            <p>
              When you design a distributed system, you don't default to "everyone stop and join a call." You assume:
            </p>

            <ul class="blogpost__list">
              <li>coordination is expensive,</li>
              <li>latency exists,</li>
              <li>people (and nodes) are doing real work,</li>
              <li>and interrupt-driven architectures collapse under load.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>So we apply the same principle to human work.</p>

            <p><strong>Synchronous communication is sometimes necessary. It is not the default.</strong></p>
          </section>

          <section class="blogpost__section" aria-labelledby="s-3">
            <h2 id="s-3">Communication is not an asset. It's a cost.</h2>

            <p>This is where we depart from a lot of modern corporate culture.</p>

            <p>
              We don't treat communication like an unlimited good. We treat it like compute and bandwidth.
            </p>

            <p><strong>Communication is a cost.</strong></p>

            <p>
              And like any serious system, we actively reduce costs that don't produce proportional value.
            </p>

            <p>Because we've seen the failure mode-both in systems and in organizations:</p>

            <ul class="blogpost__list">
              <li>too many meetings,</li>
              <li>too many check-ins,</li>
              <li>too many status updates that exist because nobody trusts the underlying process,</li>
              <li>too much "alignment" that is really just anxiety management,</li>
              <li>too many people blocked because the only way forward is to get time on someone's calendar.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              Communication overhead is a major reason systems fail. That's not a hot take. That's the textbook.
            </p>

            <p>So our cultural commitment is not "we communicate a lot."</p>

            <p><strong>It's we communicate intentionally.</strong></p>

            <p><strong>We are an engineering-first company.</strong></p>

            <p>That means:</p>

            <ul class="blogpost__list">
              <li>we care about correctness and reality,</li>
              <li>we like constraints and acceptance tests,</li>

              <li>we don't confuse activity for progress.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>We are not MBAs.</p>

            <p><em>(Except our COO-but we'll forgive him for that.)</em></p>

          <section class="blogpost__section" aria-labelledby="s-6">
            <h2 id="s-6">Who thrives here</h2>

            <p>You'll probably love it here if you:</p>

            <ul class="blogpost__list">
              <li>like writing and clear thinking,</li>
              <li>prefer autonomy over constant coordination,</li>
              <li>want fewer meetings and more real build time,</li>
              <li>enjoy designing systems that scale (including the human ones),</li>
              <li>want a culture that treats your attention as valuable.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>You might not love it here if you:</p>

            <ul class="blogpost__list">
              <li>need high-frequency verbal alignment to feel safe,</li>
              <li>prefer decisions to happen in meetings instead of documents,</li>
              <li>want constant social energy throughout the workday.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              Neither is "better." But we're not going to pretend we're everything for everyone.

            <h2 id="s-7">Why we're publishing this</h2>

            <p>Because we don't want culture to be marketing.</p>

            <p>We want you to be able to evaluate us like an engineer would:</p>

            <ul class="blogpost__list">
              <li>What do you optimize for?</li>
              <li>What are your defaults?</li>
              <li>What are your failure modes?</li>
              <li>What tradeoffs are you willing to make?</li>
            </ul>

            <p>This is ours.</p>

            <p>
              If this sounds like the environment where you'd do the best work of your career, we'd love to talk.
