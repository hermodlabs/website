            <h2 id="s-1">The embarrassing question we don’t like asking</h2>

            <p>Most sensor pipelines are built on a polite fiction:</p>

            <p><strong>If we run the procedure and get a clean plot, the plot is evidence about the world.</strong></p>

            <p>That fiction works—until it doesn’t.</p>

            <p>Because the minute a pipeline fails, you discover something awkward:</p>

            <p><strong>the plot never interpreted itself.</strong></p>

            <p>
              A plot is not “reality.” A plot is a text: axes, conventions, filters, window choices, calibration
              assumptions, silent promises about what’s stable and what’s allowed to drift. Most days, those promises
              stay invisible—because everything “looks right.”
            </p>

            <p>But the real honesty problem comes before diagnosis:</p>

            <p><strong>What entitles us to treat the plot as evidence at all?</strong></p>

            <p>
              If you don’t have an answer, your pipeline becomes self-authorizing: it uses the plot to justify the
              assumptions that are required to interpret the plot. That’s not measurement. That’s story manufacturing
              with a chart aesthetic.

            <h2 id="s-2">Religion has been honest about this for a long time</h2>

            <p>
              Here’s the part modern engineering culture is weirdly shy about: interpretation is not optional.
            </p>

            <p>
              And religion—whatever you think of it—has been unusually honest about the structure of that problem.
            </p>

            <p>Religion doesn’t pretend the “data” (the text) interprets itself.</p>

            <ul class="blogpost__list">
              <li>Islam has the Qur’an, but lived meaning runs through hadith and tafsir.</li>
              <li>Judaism has the Torah, but practice is shaped through Mishnah, Talmud, and rabbinic rulings.</li>
              <li>
                The Protestant Reformation wasn’t primarily a fight over which Bible to use; it was a fight over who
                gets to interpret, by what rules, with what authority.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>The point isn’t theology. The point is the structure:</p>

            <ul class="blogpost__list">
              <li>The text stays the same.</li>
              <li>The interpretive rules are what change.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              Religion is honest that legitimacy doesn’t come from having the text. Legitimacy comes from the public
              rules that govern reading, and the visible disputes those rules create.
            </p>

            <p>
              Engineering usually does the opposite. We act like the plot is a self-evident object, and then we quietly
              smuggle in interpretive rules through “best practices,” tribal habits, and whatever the last senior
              person said with enough confidence.
            </p>

            <h2 id="s-3">The bench plot is a scripture (sorry)</h2>

            <p>When you stare at a cancellation plot, you aren’t reading “the air.” You’re reading:</p>

            <ul class="blogpost__list">
              <li>a chosen window (and pretending the window didn’t matter),</li>
              <li>a ruler (sampling rate, units, reference clocks),</li>
              <li>a pipeline (filters, resampling, “helpful” preprocessing),</li>
              <li>a model (what drift is allowed to be),</li>
              <li>and a story (what counts as success).</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              On a good day, the whole toolchain disappears into smooth operation. The notch is deep. The bars behave.
              The pipeline feels like reality.
            </p>

            <p>
              On a bad day, the scaffolding becomes visible. And once you see it, you can’t unsee it:
            </p>

            <p><strong>the plot never carried its meaning inside itself.</strong></p>

            <p>You supplied meaning through assumptions.</p>

            <p>That’s not a moral failing. That’s just what interpretation is.</p>

            <p><strong>The moral failure is pretending interpretation isn’t happening.</strong></p>

              </li>
              <li>
                Ruler-change ambiguity: sampling-rate drift masquerading as medium drift, because the pipeline can’t
                distinguish world-change from ruler-change.
              </li>
            </ul>

          <section class="blogpost__section" aria-labelledby="s-5">
            <h2 id="s-5">Here is a more historical example.</h2>

            <p>
              Most people don’t know that Galileo’s conflict with the Catholic Church was, in a deep sense, more
              theological than scientific (not because the science didn’t matter, but because the real fight was over
              who gets to set the rules for interpreting reality).
            </p>

            <p>
              Galileo was absolutely doing scientific damage to the inherited worldview. He was developing a new physics
              of motion by measuring, experimenting, mathematizing what had been handled in older Aristotelian terms
              like “natural motion” and “natural place.” Then the telescope arrived and made the heavens look less like a
              perfect, sealed realm and more like a physical place with the same kind of mess you see on Earth: moons
              around Jupiter, phases of Venus, sunspots (evidence that the old cosmic hierarchy was not as clean as
              advertised).
            </p>

            <p>
              But here’s what turns “scientific controversy” into “institutional crisis”: by Galileo’s time,
              Aristotelian physics wasn’t just a classroom preference. It had become the dominant intellectual operating
              system of European universities, and it was heavily integrated into Catholic scholastic theology (most
              famously through Thomas Aquinas’s synthesis, where Aristotle supplied the conceptual machinery for
              reasoning about nature, causation, change, and order). That integration didn’t mean “Catholic doctrine
              equals Aristotle,” but it did mean the framework had institutional gravity: it shaped how educated people
              were trained to think, and it sat close enough to doctrine that attacking it felt like destabilizing the
              whole interpretive ecology.
            </p>

            <p>
              And then Galileo did the move that made it truly theological: he didn’t just say, “nature shows this.” He
              argued about how Scripture should be read when it appears to conflict with a physical claim while he was
              already kicking the legs out from under the Aristotelian system that Catholic intellectual life had been
              trained to treat as the default operating system.
            </p>

            <p>
              By Galileo’s time, Aristotle wasn’t merely “some old philosopher.” Through the scholastic synthesis—especially
              the Aquinas-era project of welding Aristotelian metaphysics and natural philosophy into the Church’s
              intellectual architecture—Aristotle’s physics sat close to doctrine in practice, even if it wasn’t doctrine
              in principle. That normally wouldn’t have to be fatal; institutions can adapt. But it meant Galileo wasn’t
              just proposing a new model of the heavens. He was implying that the conceptual machinery a whole
              theological ecosystem had used for centuries was not merely incomplete, but wrong in the places it
              mattered.
            </p>

            <p>
              In 1615, he wrote the Letter to the Grand Duchess Christina because heliocentrism had been framed as a
              theological problem. Certain biblical passages sounded like the Sun moved and the Earth stood still, and
              therefore the new astronomy must be wrong—or worse, dangerous. Galileo’s response wasn’t “throw out
              Scripture.” It was more surgical. He argued that Scripture wasn’t trying to teach astronomy; it was trying
              to teach salvation and moral truth, and it often speaks in the language of ordinary human experience. So
              when Scripture describes the Sun “moving,” it’s describing how things appear from the ground, not
              publishing a cosmological model.
            </p>

            <p>
              Now add the historical timing: this is happening in the Counter-Reformation, when Church authorities—especially
              the Dominican-led machinery of doctrinal enforcement—were suspicious of anything that looked even faintly
              Protestant. One of the Protestant flashpoints was precisely interpretive authority: “Who gets to read the
              text, and by what rules?” So even if Galileo wasn’t trying to be Luther with a telescope, the posture of
              “reinterpret Scripture in light of evidence” could look uncomfortably adjacent to the broader “read the
              Bible for yourself” impulse that Catholic leadership was actively trying to contain.
            </p>

            <p>
              So the conflict wasn’t just “a scientist vs a church.” It was a clash of interpretive jurisdiction: a new
              physics pressuring an entrenched Aristotelian-scholastic framework with institutional legitimacy, a
              theological ecosystem trained to reason through that framework, and a Counter-Reformation context where
              interpretive flexibility itself was politically radioactive. And the part people forget is that Galileo
              wasn’t walking into this naked—he had powerful protection. He wasn’t “independent” in the modern sense; he
              was plugged into the patronage networks that made intellectual work possible. Galileo had spent years
              cultivating high-status allies in Rome, and when Cardinal Maffeo Barberini—an admirer of Galileo’s work and
              a friend in his circle—became Pope Urban VIII, Galileo effectively had a sponsor at the top. That
              relationship mattered: it bought him patience, access, and political cover (at least temporarily),
              insulating him for longer than his enemies wanted.
            </p>

            <p>
              Which is what makes the ending so painfully on-brand: after years of argument, Rome tried to contain the
              damage with a compromise of "<em>fine</em>, you can discuss Copernicus as a mathematical model, but don’t
              present it as physical truth, and don’t treat Scripture like a speed bump". When Urban VIII became pope
              (and Galileo’s patron), Galileo thought he had enough cover to write a big public-facing work that would
              “responsibly” compare the systems while staying inside the allowed lines. He even got formal permission to
              publish under those constraints.
            </p>

            <p>
              So in 1632 he released the <em>Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems</em>—a slick, accessible,
              four-day conversation designed to win educated readers, not just mathematicians. And inside it he let the
              defender of the Aristotelian position read like a fool—<em>Simplicio</em>—in a way that many contemporaries
              took as mocking the Pope’s own stance (essentially making fun of his boss). In true academic form, he won
              the argument and lost the room.

          <section class="blogpost__section" aria-labelledby="s-6">
            <h2 id="s-6">Now port the structure into engineering:</h2>

            <p>
              The Book of Plots: what our pipeline produces—charts, notches, correlations, “clean” results.<br />
              The Book of the World: what’s actually happening in the medium, the geometry, the clocks, the sensors.
            </p>

            <p>
              The danger is confusing the first for the second. If your pipeline can’t state—and test—the assumptions
              that make a plot interpretable, then your plot is not the Book of the World. It’s just the Book of Plots
              quoting itself. You haven’t earned a claim about reality; you’ve manufactured a story with a graph.
            </p>

            <p>Not as philosophical decoration, but epistemic hygiene.</p>

            <p>
              Most engineers don’t use the word for it, but this is exactly the problem that hermeneutics was invented
              to talk about. Hermeneutics is just the theory and craft of interpretation: the rules that determine what
              counts as a legitimate reading of a thing. Originally it shows up around texts (scripture, law,
              literature), because a written sentence doesn’t carry its meaning like a barcode—you only get meaning once
              you apply background assumptions about context, genre, intent, and acceptable inference. The key point is
              simple: a text does not interpret itself. If the rules stay implicit, people can “read” the same lines
              into opposite conclusions and still claim the text is on their side.
            </p>

            <p>
              Now do the engineering translation: a plot is also a text. It has axes, conventions, preprocessing,
              windows, and silent promises about what must be stable for the picture to mean what we think it means. So
              when we say “contracts, certificates, and validity gates,” we’re not adding bureaucracy—we’re writing down
              the interpretive rules that make a plot admissible as evidence.
            </p>

          <section class="blogpost__section" aria-labelledby="s-7">
            <h2 id="s-7">Hermeneutics, but as an engineering spec</h2>

            <p>Here’s the engineer translation:</p>

            <p><strong>Interpretation is allowed iff the pipeline can prove the premises required to interpret the result.</strong></p>

            <p>That’s it.</p>

            <p>Not skepticism. Not relativism. Earned interpretation.</p>

            <p>On a given window (W), interpretation is allowed only when:</p>

            <ul class="blogpost__list">
              <li>the model constraints you claim are true (what drift is allowed to do),</li>
              <li>the window is admissible (stable enough for your method),</li>
              <li>and the implementation is faithful (your “delay bricks” behave like the operator you think you’re using),</li>
              <li>and your ruler is stable (units don’t silently re-label the phenomenon).</li>
            </ul>

            <p>If those conditions don’t pass, the correct conclusion is not “nothing happened.”</p>

            <p>It’s:</p>

            <p><strong>This pipeline cannot distinguish what happened.</strong></p>

            <p>
              So you don’t upgrade the plot into a claim. You re-window, re-calibrate, refuse the run, log a reason code.
            </p>

            <p>That’s not pessimism. That’s professionalism.</p>

            <p>The co-timing engine isn’t “a better plot.” It’s a system for returning:</p>

              <li>the output,</li>
              <li>the premises required to interpret it,</li>

            <p>If a notch is deep, we want to know what was earned.</p>

            <p>If it fills in, we want to know which promise broke first.</p>

            <p>That’s how you prevent the plot from becoming both the evidence and the judge.</p>

            <p>Stop asking “does the plot look right?”</p>

            <p>Start asking “what entitles this plot to mean what we’re claiming it means?”</p>

            <p>That’s the whole game.</p>
