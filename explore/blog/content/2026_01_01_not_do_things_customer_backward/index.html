            <h2 id="s-1">A public product philosophy moment</h2>

            <p>
              If you’ve ever watched that famous Steve Jobs Q&amp;A clip—the one where someone stands up, irritated, and
              basically berates him about OpenDoc—you’ve seen a rare moment of public product philosophy under pressure.
            </p>

            <p>
              The person isn’t asking a gentle question. It’s more like: <em>Why aren’t you supporting the thing? Why
              aren’t you doing the obvious “industry standard” move? Why are you ignoring this?</em>
            </p>

            <p>
              And Jobs, very politely, does something that’s almost offensive if you’re used to corporate reassurance:
              he refuses to pretend that doing everything is a virtue.
            </p>

            <p>
              He says (paraphrasing): sometimes you have to make tough decisions to just not do things.
            </p>

            <p>
              Then he gives the line that matters, the one that’s essentially a compression algorithm for product judgment:
            </p>

            <p><strong>You start with the customer experience and you work backwards.</strong></p>

            <p>
              That’s not a slogan. It’s a design constraint.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section class="blogpost__section" aria-labelledby="s-2">
            <h2 id="s-2">Documentation is not a diary. It’s a decision system.</h2>

            <p>
              A lot of teams treat documentation as a museum: write down everything we did so future archaeologists can
              reconstruct the ruins.
            </p>

            <p>We don’t.</p>

            <p>
              We treat documentation as a <strong>decision system</strong>—a way to make the work reproducible and the
              scope defensible.
            </p>

            <p>
              Because the real failure mode in building software isn’t “we forgot to write down the API.” The real
              failure mode is subtler:
            </p>

            <ul class="blogpost__list">
              <li>the project becomes a landfill of “good ideas,”</li>
              <li>the roadmap turns into a list of vibes,</li>
              <li>and the product becomes an attempt to satisfy every possible interpretation of what the customer “might” want.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              That’s how you end up building a beautiful machine for misunderstanding.
            </p>

            <p>
              So our documentation starts where Jobs says it should start: <strong>the customer experience</strong>,
              written in a way that forces clarity.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section class="blogpost__section" aria-labelledby="s-3">
            <h2 id="s-3">Our north star: start from the job, not the feature</h2>

            <p>
              The practical version of “start from the customer and work backwards” is:
              <strong>Jobs to be Done (JTBD).</strong>
            </p>

            <p>It’s not just a marketing framework. It’s a discipline:</p>

            <p><strong>People don’t buy products. They “hire” products to get a job done.</strong></p>

            <p>
              If you’re serious, you can write the job as a sentence you can test:
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>When ___, I want to ___, so I can ___.</strong>
            </p>

            <p>
              And then everything you build either directly supports that job—or it’s a distraction you should have the
              courage to not do.
            </p>

            <p>
              This is also why documentation matters: it’s where the job is written down, preserved, and used as a
              constraint when someone proposes a shiny detour.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section class="blogpost__section" aria-labelledby="s-4">
            <h2 id="s-4">The Cigar District example: the job is inventory positioning</h2>

            <p>
              In our pilot with The Cigar District, the job is not “humidity monitoring.”
            </p>

            <p>That’s the trap.</p>

            <p>The job is something more concrete and more operational:</p>

            <p>
              <strong>
                Help Bobby (the owner) position inventory so cigars age well and stay consistent—without guesswork.
              </strong>
            </p>

            <p>
              Cigars need to be placed in ideal locations depending on what matters in that room. Not one abstract
              metric. A cluster of practical realities:
            </p>

            <ul class="blogpost__list">
              <li>stable zones vs unstable zones,</li>
              <li>pockets and gradients,</li>
              <li>drift over time,</li>
              <li>and the fact that “room average” can be fine while a specific shelf is quietly becoming a problem.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>So we work backwards from Bobby’s job:</p>

            <ul class="blogpost__list">
              <li>He needs to know where the stable zones are.</li>
              <li>He needs to know where the pockets form.</li>
              <li>He needs to know when a change is real vs when it’s sensor disagreement.</li>
              <li>He needs guidance that’s actionable: “move inventory here,” not “here’s a chart.”</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              That’s the job. Everything else is subordinate.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section class="blogpost__section" aria-labelledby="s-5">
            <h2 id="s-5">What we document (and what we intentionally do not)</h2>

            <p>
              Starting from the job changes what documentation looks like.
            </p>

            <p>
              We don’t lead with architecture diagrams and pretend they’re the point. We lead with the job and force
              ourselves to answer:
            </p>

            <ul class="blogpost__list">
              <li><strong>What is the customer trying to do?</strong></li>
              <li><strong>What does “success” look like in their language?</strong></li>
              <li><strong>What must our system produce to enable that success repeatedly?</strong></li>
              <li><strong>What do we refuse to build right now because it doesn’t move the job?</strong></li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              This is where “not doing things” becomes a feature.
            </p>

            <p>
              Because any system worth building will be attacked by feature gravity. You’ll be asked for dashboards,
              integrations, alerts, exports, historical views, “AI insights,” and a dozen other things that sound
              reasonable when you say them quickly.
            </p>

            <p>
              And many of those will be good ideas—eventually.
            </p>

            <p>
              But product maturity is partly the ability to say:
            </p>

            <p><strong>Not yet. Not here. Not for this job.</strong></p>
          </section>

          <section class="blogpost__section" aria-labelledby="s-6">
            <h2 id="s-6">Our doc stack (how we keep ourselves honest)</h2>

            <p>
              So our documentation is built as a stack that flows from the job backwards into implementation:
            </p>

            <ul class="blogpost__list">
              <li><strong>Job Statement</strong> (JTBD, written in operator language)</li>
              <li><strong>Acceptance Signals</strong> (what Bobby can observe that proves the job is being done)</li>
              <li><strong>Workflow</strong> (the steps he will actually take, including “what do I do when the system says I can’t decide?”)</li>
              <li><strong>Artifacts</strong> (maps, zone labels, diagnostics, “receipts”)</li>
              <li><strong>System Constraints</strong> (what must be true for the artifacts to be trustworthy)</li>
              <li><strong>Implementation Notes</strong> (only after everything above is pinned down)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              This prevents a common disease: documenting a system that is technically impressive but operationally
              irrelevant.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section class="blogpost__section" aria-labelledby="s-7">
            <h2 id="s-7">What this means in practice for The Cigar District</h2>

            <p>
              In the Cigar District pilot, “documentation-first” doesn’t mean writing long docs.
            </p>

            <p>It means writing the <em>right</em> docs:</p>

            <ul class="blogpost__list">
              <li>a zone map definition that Bobby can use,</li>
              <li>a catalog of recurring pockets and what triggers them,</li>
              <li>a commissioning workflow he can repeat,</li>
              <li>and clear “action recommendations with verification hooks” (before/after signals).</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              Because the job is inventory positioning. If our system can’t produce guidance that makes positioning
              better, it doesn’t matter how clean the math is.
            </p>

            <p>
              The customer experience is the audit.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section class="blogpost__section blogpost__section--updates" aria-labelledby="s-8">
            <h2 id="s-8">The takeaway</h2>

            <p>
              We agree with Jobs here, and it’s one of the few places where a simple sentence actually deserves reverence:
            </p>

            <p><strong>Start from the customer experience and work backwards.</strong></p>

            <p>
              That’s why we document from the job backwards. That’s why we use Jobs to be Done. And that’s why our pilot
              work starts with Bobby’s inventory positioning problem—not with our favorite features.
            </p>

            <p>
              Because the hardest part of building software isn’t building. It’s choosing what you refuse to build so
              the thing stays coherent.
            </p>

            <p><strong>And yes: sometimes you have to not do things.</strong></p>
