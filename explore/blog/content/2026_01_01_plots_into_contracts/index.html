            <h2 id="s-1">Last time: interpretation was the real problem</h2>

            <p>
              In the previous post, I argued something that annoys engineers on principle:
              <strong>a plot is a text.</strong>
            </p>

            <p>
              Meaning doesn’t live inside the pixels. Meaning is what you get after you apply background assumptions:
              which window counts, which ruler is stable, what drift is allowed to do, what counts as “shared,” what
              counts as “success.”
            </p>

            <p>
              If those rules stay implicit, the pipeline can become self-authorizing: the plot is used to justify the
              assumptions required to interpret the plot. That’s not measurement. That’s story manufacturing with a
              chart aesthetic.
            </p>

            <p>
              This post is the sequel: <strong>why we treat the solution as contracts, certificates, and validity gates</strong>
              — and why a handful of philosophers accidentally gave us a clean way to describe the danger.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section class="blogpost__section" aria-labelledby="s-2">
            <h2 id="s-2">Hermeneutics is not a vibe — it’s the spec for “legitimate reading”</h2>

            <p>
              Hermeneutics is just the craft and theory of interpretation: the rules that make a reading legitimate.
              It started in texts (law, scripture, literature) because a text doesn’t interpret itself.
            </p>

            <p>
              A bench plot is the same kind of object. If the interpretive rules are invisible, you can “read” the same
              plot into opposite conclusions and still claim the plot is on your side.
            </p>

            <p>
              So the question becomes operational:
              <strong>what interpretive rules must hold for a plot to be allowed to make a claim about the world?</strong>
            </p>

            <p>
              That’s the entire point of contracts, certificates, and validity gates. Not as philosophical decoration —
              as epistemic hygiene.

            <h2 id="s-4">Heidegger: breakdown reveals the hidden toolchain</h2>

            <p>
              Heidegger’s useful idea is simple: when a tool works, it disappears. When it fails, the hidden scaffolding
              becomes visible.
            </p>

            <p>
              On a “good day” bench run, the pipeline feels like reality. The notch is deep. The bars behave. The system
              becomes invisible precisely because it’s performing.
            </p>

            <p>
              On a “bad day,” the pipeline becomes conspicuous. Cancellation smears. Windows look “haunted.” And suddenly
              you can see what you were living on:
            </p>

            <ul class="blogpost__list">
              <li>the window wasn’t admissible,</li>
              <li>delays didn’t commute,</li>
              <li>the ruler drifted,</li>
              <li>the “path” didn’t behave like the model you assumed.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              That breakdown is not just annoying. It’s disclosure. It tells you the pipeline never gave you direct
              access to the world — it gave you access through promises.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Countermove:</strong> make those promises explicit and testable. If the pipeline depends on a calm
              window, say it and certify it. If it depends on delay+scale behavior, declare it and check it. If it
              depends on stable rulers, measure them.
            </p>

          <section class="blogpost__section" aria-labelledby="s-5">
            <h2 id="s-5">Gadamer: understanding is a fusion of horizons</h2>

            <p>
              Gadamer’s warning is aimed at a fantasy engineers love: “apply the method and extract meaning.”
            </p>

            <p>
              He argues understanding is not sterile extraction. We always interpret from within a horizon: training,
              language, expectations, and tradition. Those starting assumptions are not optional — they’re the equipment
              of reading.
            </p>

            <p>
              Which explains a common bench phenomenon: two competent teams can stare at the same plot and disagree
              violently while both claiming to be “data-driven.” They didn’t see different pixels. They brought
              different horizons:
            </p>

            <ul class="blogpost__list">
              <li>different definitions of “valid window,”</li>
              <li>different priors about drift and stationarity,</li>
              <li>different tolerances for ambiguity,</li>
              <li>different meanings of “success.”</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              <strong>Countermove:</strong> standardize the horizon with explicit contracts. Don’t let “what counts” live
              in oral tradition. Write it down. Make it checkable. Make it fail loudly.
            </p>

          <section class="blogpost__section" aria-labelledby="s-6">
            <h2 id="s-6">Ricoeur: suspicion is necessary — but restoration is the goal</h2>

            <p>
              Ricoeur names a modern habit: the hermeneutics of suspicion. After enough times being lied to by “obvious”
              interpretations, you learn to distrust the surface reading.
            </p>

            <p>
              In engineering terms: suspicion is the refusal to let “it notched” be the end of the story.
              <em>It notched, therefore it’s physics</em> is not a proof — it’s a temptation.
            </p>

            <p>
              But Ricoeur also warns that suspicion can harden into permanent cynicism. If suspicion is all you have,
              you don’t get truth — you get better ways to doubt everything.
            </p>

            <p>
              So he pairs suspicion with restoration: rebuild meaning in a form that has earned the right to be trusted.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Countermove:</strong> certificates and receipts. Not vibes. Artifacts that turn an oral story into a
              public object:
            </p>

            <ul class="blogpost__list">
              <li>what was assumed,</li>
              <li>what was tested,</li>
              <li>what passed,</li>
              <li>what failed,</li>
              <li>and why the interpretation is allowed (or not allowed).</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              That’s how suspicion becomes testable and restoration becomes legitimate.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section class="blogpost__section" aria-labelledby="s-7">
            <h2 id="s-7">Derrida: write your certificate like a hostile reader will exploit it</h2>

            <p>
              Derrida is useful here as a security posture. The moment you introduce a certificate, you create a new
              surface where belief can be manufactured.
            </p>

            <p>
              If “valid window \(W\)” is operator-chosen, someone can window-shop until the rig has a lucky calm stretch
              and call it a property of the world.
            </p>

            <p>
              If “deep notch” is the headline metric, someone can deepen the notch for the wrong reasons: over-flex a
              warp until “drift” becomes a broom, or tune preprocessing until the metric passes while the physics stays
              ambiguous.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Countermove:</strong> write the contract layer like a security protocol:
            </p>

            <ul class="blogpost__list">
              <li>freeze how \(W\) is chosen (anti window-shopping),</li>
              <li>bound admissible complexity (anti “drift broom”),</li>
              <li>add decoy checks that fail when you’re merely subtracting,</li>
              <li>make the easiest way to pass be the honest way: actually earning the interpretation.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              Interpretation doesn’t vanish when you add rules. It relocates into the loopholes. So you close the loopholes.

            <p>
              We’re trying to prevent the plot from being both the evidence and the judge.
            </p>

            <p>
              The contract stack is our operational definition of entitlement:
              interpretation is allowed only when the premises required to interpret the result have passed on the same
              window.
            </p>

            <p>
              If entitlement fails, the conclusion is not “nothing happened.” The conclusion is:
              <strong>this pipeline cannot distinguish what happened.</strong>
            </p>

            <p>
              So you don’t upgrade the plot into a claim. You reject the window, re-window, re-estimate, re-calibrate,
              log a reason code, and refuse to pretend.
            </p>

            <p>
              If interpretation is consequential, write down the rules that authorize interpretation.
            </p>

            <ul class="blogpost__list">
