            <p>
              This is a follow-up to <em>“Why We Turn Plots Into Contracts (Heidegger, Gadamer, Ricoeur, Derrida)”</em>.
              That post argued that plots are texts, and that pipelines manufacture belief when the plot is used to
              justify the assumptions required to interpret the plot. We ended on the practical claim:
              <strong>contracts, certificates, and validity gates are epistemic hygiene</strong>—the paperwork that
              prevents the plot from becoming both the evidence and the judge.
            </p>

            <p>
              This post goes one layer deeper. Not “more philosophy for fun,” but the logical spine behind our shared-use
              stance:
            </p>

            <p><strong>“Correct” can’t be a private feeling about a plot. It needs a public check.</strong></p>

            <p>
              And yes, this has a surprisingly clean historical lineage:
              logical positivism → Gödel → later Wittgenstein → private language → shared use → engineering contracts.
            </p>

            <p>
              I want you to feel that progression, because it’s the same progression we’re building into the design.

            <h2 id="s-2">1) The original dream: make meaning behave like engineering</h2>

            <p>
              Start with an engineer-sympathetic sentence:
            </p>

            <p><strong>A representation is not decoration; it’s a set of permissions.</strong></p>

            <p>
              It says: “these manipulations preserve meaning, and these ones don’t.”
            </p>

            <p>
              In other words: a good representation is like a clean interface. It doesn’t just display reality. It tells
              you what moves are legal—what transformations keep you honest.
            </p>

            <p>
              That’s why the early 20th-century dream is so relatable: what if you could build a language where every
              symbol had a job description, and every inference was a licensed move? What if correctness could be
              audited the way we audit well-typed code?
            </p>

            <p>
              That dream shows up as logical positivism.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section class="blogpost__section" aria-labelledby="s-3">
            <h2 id="s-3">2) Logical positivism: meaning = a test plan</h2>

            <p>
              In the 1920s and 30s, the Vienna Circle tried to make philosophy behave like QA for science. Their core
              discipline was the verification principle:
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>
                A sentence earns cognitive meaning only insofar as you can say what would count as checking it.
              </strong>
            </p>

            <p>
              Meaning, on this view, is basically a test plan. If a claim can’t be tied—even in principle—to public
              procedures of observation and verification, then it’s not “deep.” It’s bookkeeping without receipts.
            </p>

            <p>
              Once you accept that, you want a language whose <strong>grammar</strong> makes verification explicit.
            </p>

            <p>
              And here’s a distinction that matters to engineers:
            </p>

            <ul class="blogpost__list">
              <li><strong>Syntax</strong> is the shape of the marks (what fits together).</li>
              <li><strong>Grammar</strong> is the rules of use (what the fit permits, what counts as a valid move, what can be inferred without changing the claim).</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              Engineering analogy: syntax is the connector that plugs in. Grammar is the interface contract: what signals
              it may carry, what transformations preserve meaning, what checks certify correctness.
            </p>

            <p>
              That’s the “logical atomism” impulse: reduce complex claims to atomic propositions, then compute
              correctness from publicly checkable facts.
            </p>

            <p>
              This is why engineers intuitively like early Wittgenstein: it’s the fantasy of a perfect interface—well-defined
              operators, well-defined inputs, outputs you can audit.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section class="blogpost__section" aria-labelledby="s-4">
            <h2 id="s-4">3) Gödel: there is no final in-house stamp</h2>

            <p>
              Then Gödel hits the strongest version of the dream: Hilbert’s program.
            </p>

            <p>
              Hilbert’s ambition wasn’t just “math is elegant.” It was security: turn mathematics into an audited
              machine. Fix axioms and rules, then prove—by safe internal means—that the system is consistent, ideally
              complete, and able to certify its own safety.
            </p>

            <p>
              Gödel’s incompleteness theorems break the “closed rulebook” fantasy for any system strong enough to
              express arithmetic:
            </p>

            <ul class="blogpost__list">
              <li>You can’t have the full package: <strong>complete + consistent + self-certified</strong>.</li>
              <li>If your system is consistent, there will be truths it cannot prove.</li>
              <li>And crucially: the system cannot certify its own global safety from within itself.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              Gödel doesn’t say “checks don’t matter.” He says:
              <strong>no matter how disciplined your symbol game is, there is no final internal certificate that makes correctness automatic everywhere.</strong>
            </p>

            <p>
              So the positivist mood takes a wound. Even with immaculate formal rules, the guarantee you want is not
              something the system can supply purely by introspection. Somewhere, correctness depends on criteria that
              are not “just internal syntax.”
            </p>

            <p>
              This is the first moral we import into engineering:
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>
                A pipeline cannot be allowed to certify itself by merely producing outputs that look convincing.
                Internal cleanliness is not enough. You need checks that can fail in public.
              </strong>
            </p>

          <section class="blogpost__section" aria-labelledby="s-5">
            <h2 id="s-5">4) Later Wittgenstein: “correct” collapses without public criteria</h2>

            <p>
              Wittgenstein’s later move (in <em>Philosophical Investigations</em>) attacks the problem from another angle:
              what makes any language meaningful at all?
            </p>

            <p>
              His key point is brutally simple:
            </p>

            <p><strong>A rule is only a rule if you can, in principle, get it wrong.</strong></p>

            <p>
              If “correct” collapses into “seems right to me,” then “mistake” has no foothold. And without the
              possibility of mistake, there is no standard of correctness—because there is nothing that distinguishes
              “I did it right” from “it feels right again.”
            </p>

            <p>
              That’s the private-language trap.
            </p>

            <p>
              Imagine someone tries to invent a language whose words refer to sensations only they can access. They
              write “S” in a diary whenever the sensation occurs, believing they can use the sign correctly by
              recognizing the sensation later.
            </p>

            <p>
              Wittgenstein’s point is not that the person is lying. It’s that, in a purely private setting, the idea of
              <strong>using the sign correctly</strong> collapses—because the only “check” is the same inner feeling
              you’re trying to name. The supposed criterion is not independent of the act being judged.
            </p>

            <p>
              So the sign becomes a diary mark: it can accompany experience, but it cannot discipline inference.
            </p>

            <p>
              This is the second moral we import:
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>
                Correctness needs a criterion. If there is no public criterion—no stable difference between “seems right”
                and “is right”—then “correct” is not a property. It’s a mood.

            <h2 id="s-6">5) The engineering translation: plots can become a private language</h2>

            <p>
              This is exactly the failure mode we’re trying to prevent in timing work.
            </p>

            <p>
              Without explicit, checkable rules, plots turn into private language:
            </p>

            <ul class="blogpost__list">
              <li>“this looks aligned,”</li>
              <li>“the notch looks deep enough,”</li>
              <li>“the unwrap seems fine,”</li>
              <li>“the residual feels small.”</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              These phrases sound technical, but without shared criteria they collapse into: “I know it when I see it.”
            </p>

            <p>
              And the next day, with different noise, someone else doesn’t see it.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Shared use</strong> is the engineering translation of Wittgenstein’s public criterion:
            </p>

            <ul class="blogpost__list">
              <li>Two people can run the same procedure on the same window <em>W</em>,</li>
              <li>under the same declared assumptions,</li>
              <li>and agree on success or failure for a reason.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              That’s what it means to take “correct” out of private certainty and put it into public practice.
            </p>

            <p>
              So the danger is not just philosophical. It is operational:
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>
                If “correct” is defined by private visual confidence, the pipeline becomes a belief-manufacturing machine.
              </strong>

          <section class="blogpost__section" aria-labelledby="s-7">
            <h2 id="s-7">6) Our response: contracts as public criteria</h2>

            <p>
              So we respond the way instrument builders respond: replace interpretive vibes with <strong>public criteria</strong>.
            </p>

            <p>
              In our system, those criteria are contracts.
            </p>

            <p>
              A contract is not “what we hope is true.” It’s a statement of the form:
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>
                If these stated conditions hold, then these manipulations are licensed, and these checks decide whether
                they actually held on this run.
              </strong>
            </p>

            <p>
              That’s what makes the claim public: anyone can rerun the checks and agree (or disagree) for a reason.
            </p>

            <p>
              A timing claim becomes instrument-grade when it comes with:
            </p>

            <ul class="blogpost__list">
              <li>
                <strong>Conditions</strong> — what must be true for the move to be meaningful (which window <em>W</em>, which
                band, which sign convention, which “same up to delay” assumption).
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Licensed operations</strong> — what you are allowed to do if those conditions hold (estimate
                <em>Δτ*</em>, apply a delay brick, subtract/cancel, interpret residual).
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Criteria</strong> — what counts as success or failure in a checkable way (coherence, unwrap stability,
                notch depth, residual structure, and “which promise broke first” diagnostics).
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              Then we implement those criteria with a deliberately small vocabulary:
            </p>

            <ul class="blogpost__list">
              <li><strong>E-rails</strong>: what a path is allowed to be (delay + scale, and nothing more).</li>
              <li><strong>Q-landmarks</strong>: when the world is calm enough for the story (a window <em>W</em> where “same up to delay” is defensible).</li>
              <li><strong>Certificates</strong>: the public criteria—machine-run tests that return a verdict and, when needed, a reason category.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              This is the anti-private-language move.
            </p>

            <p>
              “Correct” is not “it looks aligned to me.” It is “the certificate passed under the declared promises.”
            </p>

            <p>
              And when it fails, the system doesn’t hand you a fresh narrative. It hands you a diagnosis.
            </p>

            <h2 id="s-8">7) The logical development, in one line</h2>

            <p>
              Logical positivism tried to make meaning = verification. Gödel showed there’s no closed internal rulebook
              that certifies everything from the inside. Wittgenstein showed “correct” collapses without public criteria.
              And sensor pipelines, left alone, reinvent the private-language trap by turning plots into diary marks.
            </p>

            <p>
              So our design response is not aesthetic. It’s the logical conclusion:
            </p>

            <p><strong>If correctness must be public, then the pipeline must produce public criteria.</strong></p>

            <p>
              That’s why shared use is non-negotiable for us. That’s why E-rails and Q-landmarks exist. That’s why we
              keep insisting on certificates.
            </p>

            <p>
              Because the practical moral is simple:
            </p>

            <p><strong>If you cannot say what would count as correct, you are not measuring yet.</strong></p>
