            <p>
              I keep thinking the central problem people are having with LLMs is not that the models are “wrong.”
              It’s that we keep treating language like a vending machine.
            </p>

            <p>
              Put prompt in. Truth comes out.
              Or at least: <em>the kind of truth we want comes out.</em>
            </p>

            <p>
              And when it doesn’t, we do the same thing we do with sensor plots on a bad day: we blame the output, blame
              the user, blame the model, blame the data, blame the alignment team, blame the moon phase — anything
              except the one thing we’re allergic to admitting:
            </p>

            <p><strong>we don’t actually know what we’re doing when we use language.</strong></p>

            <p>
              Language is not a transparent pipe. Language is a toolchain. It has grammar, context, background
              assumptions, norms, genre, implied goals, “what counts as an answer,” and the ability to quietly change
              the question without telling you it changed the question. Which is why two people can read the same
              sentence and come away with different realities, and both think they’re being “literal.”
            </p>

            <p>
              This is also why the whole “LLMs hallucinate” discourse feels… slightly off. Not wrong. Just incomplete.
              Because the accusation smuggles in a fantasy: that the user asked a stable question, that the model owes a
              stable kind of answer, that “correctness” was defined, that the world being referred to was agreed upon,
              that the method of verification was clear, that the conversation contained a public criterion for
              success.
            </p>

            <p>And most of the time, none of that is true.</p>

            <p>We’re doing private language again.</p>
            <p>We’re making diary marks out of sentences.</p>
            <p>We’re calling vibes “meaning.”</p>
            <p>We’re calling plausible completion “knowledge.”</p>

            <p>
              If you want a pop-culture version of what I mean, Douglas Adams already wrote it.
            </p>

            <p>
              In <em>Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy</em>, the machine gives the answer to “the meaning of life” as
              <strong>42</strong> and everyone loses their mind. And then someone points out the real disaster:
            </p>

            <p><strong>“The problem wasn't the that they didn't understand the answer. The problem is that they didn't even understand the question.”</strong></p>

            <p>That’s LLM discourse in one line.</p>

            <p>
              People don’t realize they’re asking questions that aren’t questions. They’re asking rituals. They’re
              asking for “insight.” They’re asking for the feeling of certainty. They’re asking for a story that
              matches the shape of their anxiety. They’re asking for an oracle that will certify a worldview without
              requiring the embarrassment of defining terms.
            </p>

            <p>
              Then the model replies with something that sounds like an answer — because that’s what it’s built to do —
              and everyone starts arguing about whether the answer is true, without noticing the missing part:
            </p>

            <ul class="blogpost__list">
              <li>what would count as checking it?</li>
              <li>what is the claim, exactly?</li>
              <li>what world are we talking about?</li>
              <li>what constraints are in play?</li>
              <li>what are the allowed moves?</li>
              <li>what would falsify this?</li>
              <li>what does “correct” even mean here?</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              And if those aren’t explicit, you get the same self-authorizing loop we’ve been talking about:
            </p>

            <p><strong>the output justifies the assumptions required to interpret the output.</strong></p>

            <p>
              If you want to see how this becomes a social failure mode: people treat “the model said it” as if it were
              a certificate. But a certificate isn’t a sentence. A certificate is a public check: it comes with
              conditions, procedures, and failure modes. It is designed to survive hostile reading.
            </p>

            <p>LLMs don’t do that automatically.</p>
            <p>And neither do humans.</p>

            <p>
              So the real fight isn’t “are LLMs good or bad?”
              The real fight is: do we have a public language for correctness, or are we just trading private
              impressions and calling it knowledge?
            </p>

            <p>
              Because if correctness collapses into “seems right,” then mistakes don’t even have a foothold. The system
              becomes a private language generator. You can always tell a story. You can always retrofit a cause. You
              can always find a completion that matches your mood.
            </p>

            <p>
              Which is why I think the “LLM problem” is also a language problem. It’s the same problem we hit with
              sensor pipelines, just wearing a different costume:
            </p>

            <p>
              We want a world where interpretation is automatic, where the text speaks for itself, where the plot means
              what we hope it means, where the model outputs “truth” the way a calculator outputs arithmetic.
            </p>

            <p>But language doesn’t work that way.</p>
            <p>And neither does measurement.</p>
            <p>And neither does trust.</p>

            <p>
              So the uncomfortable conclusion is boring and operational:
            </p>

            <p>If you want to use LLMs seriously, you need contracts.</p>
            <p>You need shared criteria.</p>
            <p>You need public checks.</p>
            <p>
              You need to state what would count as correct — and what would count as wrong — before you start treating
              a paragraph as evidence.
            </p>

            <p>
              Otherwise you’ll keep getting “42” and fighting about whether it’s true, while missing the real punchline:
            </p>

            <p><strong>“The problem wasn't the that they didn't understand the answer. The problem is that they didn't even understand the question.”</strong></p>
