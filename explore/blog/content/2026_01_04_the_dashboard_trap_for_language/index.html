            <p>
              I keep thinking the central problem people are having with LLMs is not that the models are &ldquo;wrong.&rdquo; 
              It&rsquo;s that we keep treating language like a vending machine.
            </p>

            <p>
              Put prompt in. Truth comes out. Or at least: the kind of truth we want comes out.
            </p>

            <p>
              And when it doesn&rsquo;t, we do the same thing we do with sensor plots on a bad day: 
              blame the output, blame the user, blame the model,
              blame the data, blame the alignment team, blame the moon phase.
              We'll blame anything except the one thing we&rsquo;re allergic to admitting:
            </p>

            <p>we don&rsquo;t actually know what we&rsquo;re doing when we use language.</p>

            <p>
              That&rsquo;s not a &ldquo;LLM problem.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s the same operator problem I just described in 
              <em>The Dashboard Trap</em> — wearing a nicer hoodie.
            </p>

          <section class="blogpost__section" aria-labelledby="s-2">
            <h2 id="s-2">The same hidden contract, now with sentences</h2>

            <p>
              Because the dashboard trap is not “bad charts.” It’s a hidden contract:
            </p>

            <div class="blogpost__callout" role="note" aria-label="Dashboard contract">
              <p><strong>“We will give you data.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>You will provide meaning, decisions, and accountability.”</strong></p>
            </div>

            <p>
              LLMs are the same deal, just with sentences instead of time series.
            </p>

            <div class="blogpost__callout" role="note" aria-label="LLM contract">
              <p><strong>“We will give you plausible text.</strong></p>
              <p>
                <strong>
                  You will provide the definitions, the world-model, the constraints, the success criteria, and the verification plan.”
                </strong>
              </p>
            </div>

            <p>
              So when we say “LLMs hallucinate,” it’s not wrong. It’s just incomplete. Because that accusation smuggles in a fantasy:
            </p>

            <ul class="blogpost__list">
              <li>that the user asked a stable question,</li>
              <li>that the model owes a stable kind of answer,</li>
              <li>that “correctness” was defined,</li>
              <li>that the world being referred to was agreed upon,</li>
              <li>that the method of verification was clear,</li>
              <li>that the conversation contained a public criterion for success.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>And most of the time, none of that is true.</p>

            <p>We’re doing private language again.</p>
            <p>We’re making diary marks out of sentences.</p>
            <p>We’re calling vibes “meaning.”</p>
            <p>We’re calling plausible completion “knowledge.”</p>
          </section>

          <section class="blogpost__section" aria-labelledby="s-3">
            <h2 id="s-3">Dashboards already taught us this lesson</h2>

            <p>
              Now zoom out: this is <em>exactly</em> how dashboards break operators.
            </p>

            <p>
              The dashboard says: <strong>“Humidity looks good.”</strong>
              The shelf is drifting. The corner is forming a pocket. Two sensors disagree. And you can’t tell if it’s real.
            </p>

            <p>
              So you do what every operator does: you start playing detective. You invent folklore.
            </p>

            <ul class="blogpost__list">
              <li>“That sensor always reads high.”</li>
              <li>“This corner is always weird.”</li>
              <li>“Ignore it unless it stays weird for three days.”</li>
              <li>“We’ll adjust later.”</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              None of that is stupidity. It’s survival in a system that can’t help you decide.
            </p>

            <p>
              And then we make the same mistake twice: we put “AI insights” on top of the dashboard and act surprised when the insights are also… vibes.
            </p>

            <p>Of course they are.</p>

            <p>
              If the underlying instrument is still asking the human to supply meaning, then the “AI layer” is just hallucinating on top of hallucination —
              not because it’s malicious, but because the inputs never contained a public definition of “what counts as true” in the first place.
            </p>

          <section class="blogpost__section" aria-labelledby="s-4">
            <h2 id="s-4">Language is not a pipe</h2>

            <p>
              Language is not a transparent pipe. Language is a toolchain. It has grammar, context, background assumptions, norms, genre, implied goals,
              “what counts as an answer,” and the ability to quietly change the question without telling you it changed the question.
              Which is why two people can read the same sentence and come away with different realities, and both think they’re being “literal.”
            </p>

            <p>Same with charts.</p>
            <p>Same with dashboards.</p>
            <p>Same with trust.</p>

          <section class="blogpost__section" aria-labelledby="s-5">
            <h2 id="s-5">42 is the correct answer to the wrong question</h2>

            <p>
              If you want a pop-culture version of what I mean, Douglas Adams already wrote it.
            </p>

            <p>
              In <em>Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</em>, the machine gives the answer to “the meaning of life” as 42 and everyone loses their mind.
              And then someone points out the real disaster:
            </p>

            <div class="blogpost__callout" role="note" aria-label="Douglas Adams punchline">
              <p>
                <strong>
                  “The problem wasn't that they didn't understand the answer. 
                  The problem was that they didn't even understand the question.”
                </strong>
              </p>
            </div>

            <p>That's LLM discourse in one line.</p>

            <p>
              People don't realize that they're not actually asking questions. 
              They're performing rituals. 
              They're praying to the gods for “insight.”
              They're asking for the feeling of certainty. 
              They're asking for a story that matches the shape of their anxiety.
              They're asking for an oracle that will certify their worldview without requiring 
              the embarrassment of defining terms.
            </p>

            <p>
              Then the model replies with something that <em>sounds</em> like an answer &mdash; 
              because that&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s built to do &mdash;
              and everyone starts arguing about whether the answer is true, 
              without noticing the missing part:
            </p>

            <ul class="blogpost__list">
              <li>what would count as checking it?</li>
              <li>what is the claim, exactly?</li>
              <li>what world are we talking about?</li>
              <li>what constraints are in play?</li>
              <li>what are the allowed moves?</li>
              <li>what would falsify this?</li>
              <li>what does “correct” even mean here?</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              And if those aren&rsquo;t explicit, you get the same self-authorizing loop operators live in:
            </p>

            <p>the output justifies the assumptions required to interpret the output.</p>

            <h2 id="s-6">A certificate isn&rsquo;t a sentence</h2>

            <p>
              This is where the dashboard trap becomes a social failure mode.
            </p>

            <p>
              People treat &ldquo;the model said it&rdquo; the way they treat &ldquo;the dashboard shows it&rdquo; 
              as if it were a certificate.
            </p>

            <p>But a certificate isn&rsquo;t a sentence.</p>

            <p>
              A certificate is a public check: it comes with conditions, procedures, and failure modes. 
              It is designed to survive hostile reading.
            </p>

            <p>LLMs don&rsquo;t do that automatically.</p>
            <p>Dashboards don&rsquo;t do that automatically.</p>
            <p>And neither do humans.</p>
          </section>

          <section class="blogpost__section" aria-labelledby="s-7">
            <h2 id="s-7">The real fight: public language for correctness</h2>

            <p>
              So the real fight isn&rsquo;t &ldquo;are LLMs good or bad?&rdquo; 
              The real fight is the one operators have already been fighting for decades:
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>
                Do we have a public language for correctness, or are we just trading private impressions 
                and calling it knowledge?
              </strong>
            </p>

            <p>
              Because if correctness collapses into &ldquo;seems right,&rdquo; then mistakes don&rsquo;t 
              even have a foothold. The system becomes a private-language generator.
              You can always tell a story. You can always retrofit a cause. You can always find a completion 
              that matches your mood.
            </p>

            <p>
              Which is why I think the &ldquo;LLM hallucination problem&rdquo; is the same problem as the 
              &ldquo;dashboard hallucination problem&rdquo;:
            </p>

            <ul class="blogpost__list">
              <li>Interpretation without contracts.</li>
              <li>Meaning without receipts.</li>
              <li>Decision-making without public checks.</li>
            </ul>
          </section>

          <section class="blogpost__section blogpost__section--updates" aria-labelledby="s-8">
            <h2 id="s-8">The uncomfortable conclusion</h2>

            <p>So the uncomfortable conclusion is boring and operational:</p>

            <p>If you want to use LLMs seriously, you need contracts.</p>
            <p>You need shared criteria.</p>
            <p>You need public checks.</p>

            <p>
              You need to state what would count as correct &mdash; and what would count as wrong &mdash; 
              <em>before</em> you start treating a paragraph as evidence.
            </p>

            <p>That&rsquo;s also what a real operator tool does.</p>

            <p>Not &ldquo;here are the numbers.&rdquo; Not &ldquo;here are the insights.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>But:</p>

            <ul class="blogpost__list">
              <li>here is what is stable vs unstable,</li>
              <li>here is the pocket that forms (and when it forms),</li>
              <li>here is whether the change is likely real or sensor disagreement,</li>
              <li>here is the recommended action,</li>
              <li>here is how you verify it worked,</li>
              <li>and when we can&rsquo;t decide, here&rsquo;s the next safe step.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              Otherwise we&rsquo;ll keep getting &ldquo;42&rdquo; &mdash; from dashboards, from models, 
              and from each other &mdash; and fighting about whether it&rdquo;s true,
              while missing the real punchline:
