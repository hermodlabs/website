              <strong>Scenario:</strong> “Perfect data” from two sensors produces the wrong subtraction.
              The team has two streams, both stable, both calibrated, both “clean.” They difference them to find anomalies.
              The difference screams. Panic begins.
            </p>

            <div class="feature-callout" role="note" aria-label="Case setup">
              <p class="feature-callout__title">
                The plan is simple:
              </p>
              <ul class="feature-list">
                <li>collect two streams,</li>
                <li>subtract to cancel the common component,</li>
                <li>threshold the residual,</li>
                <li>automate a response.</li>

            <p class="feature-section__text">
              The dashboard shows high confidence. The residual looks “real.” The team escalates.
              They are about to tune the whole system… based on a subtraction of two different moments.
            </p>

            <h3 class="feature-subtitle">What quietly happened (a.k.a. you subtracted time)</h3>
            <p class="feature-section__text">
              One stream was delayed by a small, drifting offset: a buffer, a wireless hop, a clock skew, a queue.
              It wasn’t large enough to trip any “sensor health” checks, but it was enough to break comparability.
              The difference operation converted timing mismatch into a fake anomaly.
            </p>

            <ol class="feature-steps feature-steps--compact">
              <li class="feature-steps__item">
                <strong>They assumed comparability.</strong>
                “Same sensor type, same room, same timestamp format” became “same time.”
              </li>
              <li class="feature-steps__item">
                <strong>They subtracted without validating co-timing.</strong>
                Cancellation was attempted before alignment was proven on window <code>W</code>.
              </li>
              <li class="feature-steps__item">
                <strong>The residual looked meaningful.</strong>
                It was stable, structured, and perfectly wrong.
              </li>
            </ol>

            <h3 class="feature-subtitle">Then the team did the usual thing</h3>
            <p class="feature-section__text">
              Meetings. Recalibrations. Threshold widening. “Maybe Sensor B is noisy.”
              Eventually: “We need more sensors.” The system gets busier without getting truer.
            </p>

            <h3 class="feature-subtitle">Same story, with Co-Timing Validity</h3>
            <p class="feature-section__text">
              Co-Timing Validity runs first. It estimates the relative delay on <code>W</code> and checks closure/residual.
              The moment it detects non-commuting behavior or drift beyond tolerance, it refuses to certify comparability:
            </p>

            <pre class="feature-receipt__code" aria-label="Validity gate example">
Decision:
- Co-timed = NO
- Reason: closure residual above tolerance; drift signature detected
- Guidance: pause subtraction; re-align streams or change scope</pre>

            <p class="feature-section__text">
              The operator conversation changes from blame to structure:
              <strong>“Is this disagreement physics… or timing?”</strong>
            </p>

            <h3 class="feature-subtitle">Takeaway</h3>
            <p class="feature-section__text">
              If you can’t prove co-timing on a window, you can’t trust subtraction, correlation, or thresholds.
              Co-Timing Validity is how you stop timing mismatch from becoming confident anomalies—and start acting only on comparable evidence.
