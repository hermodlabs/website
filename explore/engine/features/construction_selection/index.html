            <h3 class="feature-subtitle">What quietly happened (a.k.a. frame-switching after the fact)</h3>
            <p class="feature-section__text">
              The team did not select a construction using a declared rule.
              They explored options until the output felt safe, then back-filled the rationale.
              The “best” model was whichever one made the KPI green and reduced uncomfortable questions.

              <li class="feature-steps__item">
                <strong>The candidate set was undefined.</strong>
                New constructions appeared midstream (“just trying something”).
              </li>
              <li class="feature-steps__item">
                <strong>The rule was implicit.</strong>
                “Best” meant “easiest to defend in a meeting.”
              </li>
              <li class="feature-steps__item">
                <strong>Selection was unstable.</strong>
                Next week, a different model “wins” because the window changed.
              </li>
            </ol>

            <h3 class="feature-subtitle">Then the organization normalized it</h3>
            <p class="feature-section__text">
              Different teams kept different constructions.
              Dashboards disagreed.
              Postmortems became fights about which frame was “the real one.”
              Eventually, leadership chose the calmest chart as the official reality.
            </p>

            <h3 class="feature-subtitle">Same story, with Construction Selection</h3>
            <p class="feature-section__text">
              With Construction Selection, the candidate set <code>𝓜</code> is declared and frozen,
              the rule <code>R</code> is explicit, and each candidate produces receipts.
              If the winner is unstable or violates constraints, the system downgrades the claim instead of silently swapping frames:
            </p>

            <pre class="feature-receipt__code" aria-label="Selection gate example">
Decision:
- Selected = NONE
- Reason: selection instability across adjacent windows; ties within tolerance
- Guidance: narrow candidate set 𝓜 or strengthen rule R before action</pre>

            <p class="feature-section__text">
              The conversation stops being “which model do we like” and becomes:
              <strong>“What rule do we accept—and what does instability imply about the environment?”</strong>
            </p>

            <h3 class="feature-subtitle">Takeaway</h3>
            <p class="feature-section__text">
              If selection is not controlled and reproducible, “best model” is just a social process.
              Construction Selection is how you prevent after-the-fact framing and keep interpretation tethered to declared rules and receipts.
