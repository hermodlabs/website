              With the stack, the proposed action is evaluated gate-by-gate.
              If any required gate fails, the system blocks action and tells you why—so you can fix the right layer instead of tuning the dashboard.

            <pre class="feature-receipt__code" aria-label="Stack block example">
Proposed action: "Increase dehumidification by +10%"
Scope: window=W(2026-01-08T14:00..14:10), cfg=cfg_77D1

Gates:
- Co-timing validity: FAIL (not comparable on W)
- Interpretive entitlement: FAIL (regime shift detected)
- Policy: PASS
- Risk: PASS

Decision:
- Permission-to-act = NO
- Guidance: pause automation; re-scope window; map zones; re-check validity/entitlement</pre>

              The conversation stops being “why did automation fail?” and becomes:
              <strong>“Which gate failed—and what restores permission?”</strong>

            <h3 class="feature-subtitle">Takeaway</h3>
            <p class="feature-section__text">
              When the world is spatial, temporal, and interactive, a single metric is never enough to justify action.
              The Multi-Layer Permission-to-Act Stack is how you prevent dashboards from pulling actuators—and ensure actions happen only when evidence, policy, and risk all clear.
