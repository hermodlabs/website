                    I'm Jonathan. 
                    I'm supposed to write a CEO bio here, which is already a mildly suspicious activity:
                    a small block of text trying to compress a human into a brand-shaped rectangle.
                  </p>

                  <p class="team-card__text">
                    I'm an engineer at heart, which mostly means I treat everything (including leadership) 
                    like a system that can be debugged.
                    I do not "optimize people." 
                    I optimize interfaces: how decisions get made, how information moves,
                    how incentives quietly bend outcomes, and how teams accidentally invent chaos when they don't mean to.
                  </p>

                    Nobody wakes up and says, "Today I will build a beautiful machine for misunderstanding,"
                    and yet 
                    &mdash; somehow &mdash; 
                    by Thursday we're in a recurring meeting about why the recurring meeting exists.
                  </p>

                  <p class="team-card__text">
                    That's the part of my "career summary" I can stand behind: I've spent enough time inside both large
                    companies and small ones to observe the same laws of dysfunction in different costumes.
                  </p>

                  <p class="team-card__text">
                    In big corporations, the reason a tiny startup can run circles around an established giant is not magic,
                    genius, or "hustle culture." It's simpler and more insulting: the people doing the essential work are...
                    actually doing the work. They're not trapped in an infinite loop of status updates, pre-meetings,
                    post-meetings, and calendar Tetris that turns "execution" into a spectator sport.
                  </p>

                  <p class="team-card__text">
                    And the reason most startups fail is rarely the founder's resume or vision. It's usually more
                    human than that: a lot of founders didn't start a company because they had some monastic clarity of purpose.
                    They started it because they have terrible impulse control, a suspicious relationship with risk taking, and
                    a brain that treats "this might work" like a binding contract with destiny. 
                    I say this with love, because I am not exactly writing this from a monastery.
