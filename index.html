            <div class="supporting-detail__desc">
                <p class="supporting-detail_desc--paragraph">Most data halls only “see” humidity at a few wall sensors or CRAC returns. Everything in between — the aisles, gaps between racks, corners where air doesn’t mix well — is effectively invisible.</p>
                <p class="supporting-detail_desc--paragraph">That’s the humidity blind spot: micro-zones where moisture quietly drifts out of spec while the room-average looks fine. In those pockets, electronics age faster, static risk climbs, and small control errors turn into heat and condensation problems long before a traditional sensor ever alarms.</p>
                <p class="supporting-detail_desc--paragraph">Our platform turns those blind spots into a spatial map. Instead of trusting a few points to represent the whole hall, you get continuous coverage across the room — so you can see where humidity is slipping, correct it early, and avoid the outages that only show up when it’s already too late.</p>

            <div class="supporting-detail__desc">
                <p class="supporting-detail__desc--paragraph">Data center outages don’t behave like neat averages — they follow a fat-tailed distribution. Most incidents are painful; a meaningful fraction are catastrophic. A “minor” misstep in cooling or humidity control might only show up as a brief performance blip… until the same pattern lands you in the seven-figure tail.</p>
                <p class="supporting-detail__desc--paragraph">Industry data shows that the majority of outages now clear six figures, and a growing share exceed $1M per event. That means every additional point of resilience is not just about avoiding downtime minutes; it’s about staying out of the extreme right side of the cost curve.</p>
                <p class="supporting-detail__desc--paragraph">By exposing and controlling humidity and thermal blind spots before they compound, our system is explicitly designed to bend that distribution: fewer incidents drifting into the high-cost tail, and more events contained as low-impact, routine corrections instead of headline-making failures.</p>

            <div class="supporting-detail__desc">
                <p class="supporting-detail__desc--paragraph">Cooling and humidity aren’t separate problems in a data hall — they’re two sides of the same control loop. Every change in air flow or setpoint shifts not just temperature, but how moisture moves and settles between racks, in aisles, and inside cabinets.</p>
                <p class="supporting-detail__desc--paragraph">Traditional monitoring treats these as coarse room-level numbers: a few temperature readings here, a relative humidity value there. That’s enough to keep averages “in spec,” but not enough to see the microclimates that actually stress electronics, drive condensation risk, or erode safety margins over time.</p>
                <p class="supporting-detail__desc--paragraph">Our approach treats cooling and humidity as a coupled spatial field, not a pair of independent dials. By mapping how heat and moisture co-vary across the hall, we help operators tune their cooling strategies with confidence — reducing risk, avoiding overcooling, and keeping both temperature and humidity in the narrow band where equipment and uptime are safest.</p>
